Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Titanic competition. This project focuses on Binary Classification and Feature Engineering to predict passenger survival based on historical data.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

📂 Dataset Details
The data is split into two groups:

Titanic-Dataset.csv: The training set used to build the machine learning model.

titanic-test.csv: The testing set used to see how well the model performs on unseen data.

predictions.csv: The final output generated by the model containing passenger IDs and survival predictions.

🛠️ The Pipeline
I used a structured Data Science workflow in the titanic.ipynb notebook:

Data Exploration (EDA): Analyzing correlations between features like Sex, Pclass, and Survival.

Preprocessing:

Handling missing values in the Age and Embarked columns.

Encoding categorical data (e.g., converting "Male/Female" into 0/1).

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to capture hidden patterns in the data.

Modeling: Implementing classification algorithms to find the most accurate predictor.

📊 Results
Kaggle Submission Score: 0.78708

Key Insight: Socio-economic status and gender were the strongest predictors of survival, reflecting the historical "women and children first" protocol.
